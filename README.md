# Employee-and-Manager-Salary-Calculation-Challenge
This project was about calculating the annual employee and manager salary. The program was created to manage employee salaries and handle other salary calculations for managers.  A Javascript class called employee was used with properties for variable and salary.  The department property is used to make an override in the annual salary calulation method to add a 15% bonus.  The test data used was for Bob Ross in the Digital Marketing  department who earns $6600  monthly. Another part of the test data was Debbie Little from the Finance  department who earns $7205 monthly. Each person in the test data is an individual instance of the manager class.
